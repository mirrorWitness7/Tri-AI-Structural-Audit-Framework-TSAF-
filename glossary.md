# TSAF Glossary

## Recursion Levels (L1–L7)
A rough ladder of cognitive depth used to describe how an entity reasons about the world.

- **L1 – Simple Logic**: Direct cause → effect. Slogans, 1-step rules.
- **L2 – Local Feedback**: Sees immediate consequences and simple loops (A affects B, B affects A).
- **L3 – Multi-Variable Tradeoffs**: Balances multiple factors (cost, time, risk) but still within a bounded frame.
- **L4 – Counterfactual / Strategic**: Considers “what if” scenarios, competition, and second-order effects.
- **L5 – Multi-Agent Systems**: Models incentives, institutions, culture, and game-theoretic behavior.
- **L6 – Systemic**: Sees interacting systems (regulators, markets, tech, culture) as an evolving whole.
- **L7 – Meta-Systemic / Architect**: Designs and audits entire systems and doctrines, not just single ventures.

## Recursion Score (R)
A continuous approximation (e.g., 1.0–7.0) of how deep an entity’s reasoning usually goes in practice.
- R ≈ 1.5: Binary, slogan-level thinking with minimal feedback integration.
- R ≈ 3–4: Reasonably strategic, understands tradeoffs and competition.
- R ≥ 6: Systemic / meta-systemic architect-level reasoning.

## Contradiction Stack (CS)
Number and weight of hard contradictions between public claims and observable structure (e.g., financials, behavior).
- Example: “We are extremely disciplined” vs multi‑year uncontrolled losses.
- Large CS implies identity / narrative will eventually collide with reality.

## Structural Coherence (SC)
Rough ratio of “evidence strength” to “claim complexity”.

- Let **E** = normalized strength of evidence (cash flow, traction, IP, moat).
- Let **C** = normalized complexity and ambition of claims (global, macro, moral, etc.).

SC = E / (C + ε)

- SC ≈ 1.0: Claims are well-supported.
- SC ≪ 1.0: Claims far exceed evidence (hype zone).

## Optics-to-Structure Ratio (OSR)
How much “narrative energy” vs “operational substance” a system has.

- Let **O** = optics score (media, followers, hype intensity).
- Let **S** = structural score (revenue quality, margins, resilience).

OSR = O / (S + ε)

- OSR ≈ 1: Optics roughly match structure.
- OSR ≫ 1: Influencer / hype dominated; fragile if audited.

## Narrative Entropy (NE)
Instability introduced by rapidly shifting narratives (e.g. BTC → AI → semiconductors → discipline).

- High NE = more contradictions, more enemy ammunition, faster collapse when audited.

## System Viability (SV)
Composite score approximating whether a system can survive under pressure.

One simple version:
SV = SC / (1 + CS_norm + OSR_norm + MacroRisk)

Low SV → collapse zone.

## Macro Misread
Case where a founder misinterprets a transient distortion (e.g. pandemic spike, WFH fad) as a permanent structural shift, and builds a full business model on that error.

## Moral Inversion
When a system claims to “help” a group, but its structure creates long‑term harm or instability for that same group.

Example: An unstable platform that exposes its users to sudden collapse risk.

## Founder X Archetype
An anonymized pattern:
- High optics reliance
- Strong moral or discipline narrative
- Low structural coherence
- Negative unit economics
- Significant macro or AI blind spots
