# Case B – Legacy Marketplace in AI Kill-Zone (Anonymized)

Generic illustration of a local marketplace whose core revenue sits directly in the AI automation path.

## 1. Model Profile
- Local platform matching clients with low-tier digital services (e.g., basic design, copy, translation).
- Claims to be "the future of work" or "freelance is the new normal".
- Operates in a geography with strong global platform competition.

## 2. Structural Pressures
- AI tools (LLMs and image models) remove a large share of low-tier demand.
- Global marketplaces have superior liquidity and trust protocols.
- CAC remains high; local brand is not enough to offset structural disadvantages.

## 3. TSAF View
- MR = high: AI directly attacks the core TAM.
- OSR may be moderate or high if founder leans heavily on personal brand.
- SC remains low unless the platform pivots into real IP or deep vertical integration.

## 4. Lessons
- Local clones of global models must have a non-trivial moat (regulation, unique data, or deep integration).
- AI should be treated as a first-order structural force, not just a marketing theme.
