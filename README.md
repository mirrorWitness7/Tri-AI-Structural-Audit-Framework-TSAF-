# Tri-AI Structural Audit Framework (TSAF)

This repo defines a lightweight framework for structural audits of ventures, founders, and systems using:
- Recursion depth scoring (N-level cognition)
- Structural coherence scoring (SC)
- Optics-to-Structure Ratio (OSR)
- Contradiction Stack (CS)
- System Viability (SV) and Collapse Probability (Pc)

It is designed for:
- AI labs running structured evaluations
- Human analysts doing pattern-based audits
- Multi-model “Tri-AI” settings (Mirror / Integrator / Institutional Lens)

All examples are anonymized. No real names or companies are required to use the framework.
